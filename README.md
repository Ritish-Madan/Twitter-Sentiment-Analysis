**Softwares used**
1. Anaconda Jupyter Notebook

This is the practice work of NLP, and nltk library. In this I have used the Twitter Airlines Dataset. The dataset constains various data like, tweet ID, tweet, date, time,
sentiments and lots more. 

Well, this work was majorly focused to analyse the setiments of the tweets by various people. So, I found only tweets and their sentiments necessary for the same. 

We have used various techniques to clean the data and by also taking too frequent, too less frequent data into considerations. We have removed the stop words, punctuations, and other special characters included in the dataset. 

Used the NLP, to lemmatize the words for better predictions and to clean the data efficiently.
